# Beyond RRT: Exploring Advanced Sampling-Based Methods for Path Planning  (COMP 781 Course project)

## Introduction

This repository contains all the code we used to for benchmarking the algorithm we used for the course project.  



The following are the package we imported for these python program

```python
import random
import math
import copy
import sys
import pygame
import timeit
import numpy as np
```



We encourage the code to be run by Pycharm where the SciView will keep updating the figure generated by our program.
