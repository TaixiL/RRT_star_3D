# Beyond RRT: Exploring Advanced Sampling-Based Methods for Path Planning

## Introduction

This repository contains all the code we used to for benchmarking the algorithm we used for this project.  
It also requires a ```conda``` environment to run our code.
After ```conda``` is installed on your machine, run 
 ```python
 pip install pygame
 ```
 to install the required package.


The following are the package we imported for these python program

```python
import random
import math
import copy
import sys
import pygame
import timeit
import numpy as np
```



We encourage the code to be run by Pycharm where the SciView will keep updating the figure generated by our program.

If you want to change the start, goal, step size, iteration number or obstacle list, you may change the coordinate here.
